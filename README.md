# lightning-pose_utils: Lightning Pose Utilities

YourPackage provides advanced utilities for training, analyzing, and deploying pose estimation models with a focus on efficiency and ease of use.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Begin by cloning the YourPackage repository and installing its dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/YourPackage
cd YourPackage
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` in the YourPackage directory to specify model configurations, training parameters, and dataset paths:

```yaml
model_config: config/model_config.yaml
training_config: config/training_config.yaml
data_config: config/data_config.yaml
```

Adjust the `.yaml` files according to your dataset and model requirements.

## Training Models

To train a model, run the `train_model.py` script with the desired configurations:

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py --config config.yaml
```

## Evaluating Models

For model evaluation, use the `evaluate_model.py` script, specifying the model checkpoint:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_model.py --checkpoint path/to/checkpoint.ckpt
```

## Customization and Extension

YourPackage is designed for extensibility. Add custom model architectures or data processors by extending the base classes and integrating them into the existing workflow.
