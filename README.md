# lightningpose_utils: Utilities for the Lightning Pose Framework

**Purpose:** This package provides tools to streamline data preparation, model customization, and visualization for projects using the Lightning Pose framework.

## Prerequisites

* **lightning-pose:** Please follow the installation instructions on the Lightning Pose repository: [https://github.com/Lightning-Pose/Lightning-Pose](https://github.com/Lightning-Pose/Lightning-Pose)
* **Python 3.7+:** (Or adjust the Python version requirement if needed)

## Installation

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/lightningpose_utils](https://github.com/your-username/lightningpose_utils)  # Replace with your repo URL
cd lightningpose_utils
pip install -r requirements.txt 
pip install -e . 


## Overview of Modules

* **data_utils.py:** Contains data preprocessing and augmentation helpers specifically designed for Lightning Pose input formats.
* **model_utils.py:** Provides tools for easily adjusting Lightning Pose models, such as adding layers, modifying pre-trained weights, or creating custom loss functions.
* **visualization.py:** Includes functions for overlaying predicted poses on images or videos, as well as tools for qualitative error analysis.

## Basic Usage Example

python
from lightningpose_utils import data_utils, visualization
import lightning-pose as lp

# Load a sample image (adjust according to your image loading methods)
image = ... 

# Apply preprocessing suitable for Lightning Pose models
normalized_image = data_utils.normalize_for_lightningpose(image)

# Load a Lightning Pose model 
model = lp.load_model(...)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(normalized_image)

# Visualize results
visualization.overlay_pose(image, predictions[0])
